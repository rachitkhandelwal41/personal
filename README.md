## Customizing Components

The portfolio is structured into Angular components located in the `src/app/components/` directory. Each component can be configured individually by editing its template, styles, and logic.

Example components include:

* `about` — Personal bio and introduction.
* `projects` — Showcasing projects with descriptions and links.
* `contact` — Contact form or social media links.

Feel free to add or remove components based on your needs.
